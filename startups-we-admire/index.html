That’s it. That’s the post. <a href=#we-built-a-tool-thats-it-thats-the-post class="hash g">#</a></h1><p>Okay, not quite. But yes — <a href=https://curated.dnsk.work>https://curated.dnsk.work</a> is just a simple, slightly obsessive tool we made to track the startups we keep accidentally redesigning in our heads. It’s not a lead gen gimmick. Not a case study hub. Definitely not SEO-driven (sorry, robots). Just a lovingly maintained public list of “Hey… why aren’t we working with these people?”</p><p><img src=/images/startups-we-admire.jpeg alt="Linkedin Profile Crop" loading=lazy decoding=async width=1408 height=768 class=full-width></p><p>You know those internal Slack threads where someone drops a product link and says <em>“This is kind of great. But also…”</em> — followed by 15 messages about onboarding flows, font weight choices, and how their navbar would look better with less cognitive debt?</p><p>We took that energy, put it on a webpage, and made it click-safe.</p><hr><h2 id=why-we-made-it>Why We Made It <a href=#why-we-made-it class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>Because taste isn’t just about what you ship. It’s also about what you notice.</p><p>We kept catching ourselves watching certain startups closely — not because they were clients, but because they were interesting. Clear signals. Sharp products. Great ideas just a few pixels away from greatness. Stuff that makes you want to roll up your sleeves.</p><p>At some point we realised we were doing the same dance over and over:</p><ol><li>Admire it.</li><li>Critique it (with love).</li><li>Mentally redesign a few things.</li><li>Wonder aloud how we’d approach it.</li><li>Forget to write it down.</li><li>Repeat.</li></ol><p>So we built a home for it. That’s the whole origin story. One part nerdy admiration, one part creative impulse containment system.</p><hr><h2 id=what-it-actually-is>What It Actually Is <a href=#what-it-actually-is class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>Six startups (for now). For each one:</p><ul><li>A quick note on what we love</li><li>One honest suggestion on what we’d improve</li><li>A button that says, “We’d design for them.” Because we would.</li></ul><p>No scores. No stars. No ranking. Just product crushes with commentary.</p><p>We’re not trying to dunk. We’re not trying to flatter. We’re trying to make our taste visible — and have a little fun while we’re at it.</p><hr><h2 id=a-totally-objective-highly-scientific-selection-process>A Totally Objective, Highly Scientific Selection Process™ <a href=#a-totally-objective-highly-scientific-selection-process class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>Here’s how something ends up on the list:</p><ul><li>Someone says “I love this” out loud (very important)</li><li>Another person says “But this bit…”</li><li>The thread spirals into low-key design therapy</li><li>Someone makes a Figma file</li><li>Someone else makes pasta</li><li>Eventually, it lands on curated.dnsk.work</li></ul><p>It’s not rigorous. But it is consistent. We’re drawn to products that:</p><p>– Have something to say<br>– Show strong early design instincts<br>– Are 80% of the way to being brilliant<br>– Would be <em>dangerous</em> with the right UX partner</p><hr><h2 id=examples-sure>Examples? Sure. <a href=#examples-sure class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>We’ll keep it short here, but go browse the site for the full nerdy write-ups.</p><p><strong>DEEP CLEAR</strong> – AI diagnostics for health. Super crisp idea. Could use a little more soul in the UI. Maybe a spark of motion. Something human.</p><p><strong>Fueld AI</strong> – Food tracking, but less beige. Gorgeous product logic. But the meals/journey/flow dance? Let’s talk. We have thoughts. (And recipes.)</p><p><strong>AITHENA</strong> – Pharma content review, but smart. Honestly, just let us play with the team dashboard.</p><p><strong>Fixo AI</strong> – CMMS reimagined. Love the positioning. Let’s punch up the experience to match the clarity.</p><p>They’re all like that. Specific. Respectful. Slightly itchy.</p><hr><h2 id=what-this-tool-says-about-us-whether-we-like-it-or-not>What This Tool Says About Us (Whether We Like It or Not) <a href=#what-this-tool-says-about-us-whether-we-like-it-or-not class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>Let’s be real. You can tell a lot about a person by who they admire. Same goes for studios.</p><p>This tool is a window. Into our taste. Into what excites us. Into the kinds of products we secretly want to fix when no one’s asking us to.</p><p>It’s not performative. It’s compulsive.</p><p>We literally couldn’t <em>not</em> make this.</p><p>And no, it’s not for outreach. If one of these companies reaches out, great. If not, we’ll keep quietly rooting for them — and publicly obsessing over their interface decisions like normal, healthy adults.</p><hr><h2 id=what-happens-next>What Happens Next? <a href=#what-happens-next class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>We’ll add more startups as we find them. Probably redesign one or two in private. Maybe publish a teardown if the stars align.</p><p>We’ll also keep revisiting the blurbs, because (1) taste evolves and (2) we love an excuse to update copy.</p><p>This isn’t a static wall. It’s a live conversation. One built on admiration, critique, and the belief that pointing at good things <em>and</em> asking how they could be better is one of the best things a design team can do.</p><hr><h2 id=closing-note-and-yes-its-slightly-sappy>Closing Note (And Yes, It’s Slightly Sappy) <a href=#closing-note-and-yes-its-slightly-sappy class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>This little tool? It’s a love letter to sharp teams doing smart things.</p><p>If you’re on the list, we like your work. A lot. Enough to write about it. Enough to build a site. Enough to imagine what your product could feel like at its most refined, confident, and joyful.</p><p>And if you’re not? Maybe we just haven’t found you yet. Or maybe we’re already lurking in your signup flow, wondering how your modal timing works.</p><p>Either way, thanks for making cool stuff. You make the internet less boring.</p><p>—</p><p><strong>DNSK WORK</strong><br>Design studio for digital products<br><a href=https://dnsk.work>https://dnsk.work</a></p></div></main></body></html>
