style=padding:0;margin:0><h2 class=post>Why I Stopped Sounding Like Every Other Designer on LinkedIn</h2><p><em>And what happened when I did.</em></p><hr><p><strong>&ldquo;Award-winning. Passionate. Strategic. Driven.&rdquo;</strong><br>You’ve read that sentence before — probably on my old LinkedIn profile.</p><p>It wasn’t a lie. But it also wasn’t helping.</p><p>I’m a designer. A good one. I’ve led design across enterprise tools, scaling platforms, internal systems, and launch-day MVPs. But you wouldn’t know that from the way I used to talk about myself online. My profile read like it was trying to win a scholarship. Or worse — like I wasn’t sure who I was talking to.</p><p>And that’s a problem, especially when you&rsquo;re part of a small studio trying to attract the right kind of clients.</p><hr><h2 id=the-real-problem>The Real Problem <a href=#the-real-problem class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>I wasn’t trying to land a full-time job at a bank. I’m not looking to freelance either. What I needed was positioning that reflected how I work <em>now</em> — as a product design partner, embedded in client teams, helping them untangle messy UX and scale their products with intention.</p><p>The kinds of clients we work with at DNSK WORK — founders, product leads, startups post-MVP — move quickly and expect clarity. They don’t want a CV. They want to know if you “get it.”</p><p>But instead, my old bio opened with:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;An award-winning UI/UX designer with experience in a diverse range of sectors such as tourism, automotive, entertainment, healthtech, fintech&mldr;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Which is the design equivalent of saying: “I like people and enjoy solving problems.” Cool. But not helpful. Not memorable. Not positioning.</p><p>These kinds of phrases flood LinkedIn, and most of them are just wallpaper. Vague, repetitive, non-differentiating. Everyone is a “passionate multidisciplinary product thinker.” No one is saying what they actually do, how they work, or why you should care.</p><hr><h2 id=rebuilding-the-profile-like-a-product>Rebuilding the Profile Like a Product <a href=#rebuilding-the-profile-like-a-product class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>So I treated myself like a UX problem.</p><p><strong>User:</strong> startup founder, product lead, possibly overwhelmed and under-supported.<br><strong>Pain point:</strong> too many vague profiles, too many people who say “I do UX/UI” but don’t explain how.<br><strong>Goal:</strong> make them pause, smile, and think, “I’d like to talk to this person.”</p><p>Here’s what I changed:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Before</strong></th><th><strong>After</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>“Award-winning UX/UI designer with 8+ years of experience&mldr;”</em></td><td><em>“I design the part of your product people complain about.”</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>“Helping businesses create intuitive digital experiences.”</em></td><td><em>“You know that screen no one wants to touch? That’s my happy place.”</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>“Focused on clean interfaces and best practices.”</em></td><td><em>“I design calm — even when your sprint board screams.”</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each line in the new profile does one thing: it tells the truth, quickly. It doesn’t apologise for being opinionated. It doesn’t try to be for everyone. And it definitely doesn’t sound like ChatGPT on autopilot.</p><p>I also stripped the “feature dump” mentality from my experience section. No more listing every task. I chose stories. What was the challenge? What made it messy? What made it fun?</p><p>You wouldn’t put lorem ipsum in your UI, so why are you filling your profile with it?</p><hr><h2 id=why-it-matters-more-when-youre-working-as-a-partner>Why It Matters More When You’re Working as a Partner <a href=#why-it-matters-more-when-youre-working-as-a-partner class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>When you&rsquo;re not hiding behind a big-name agency or title, your personal positioning does a lot of heavy lifting. The way you describe yourself is your introduction, your positioning, and your filter — all in one scroll.</p><p>At DNSK WORK, we operate more like a product design partner than a service vendor. That means tone matters. Clarity matters. Every line is an invitation — or a red flag.</p><p>The goal wasn’t to sound quirky. The goal was to sound like someone worth emailing.</p><hr><h2 id=the-subtle-cringe-of-sounding-like-everyone-else>The Subtle Cringe of Sounding Like Everyone Else <a href=#the-subtle-cringe-of-sounding-like-everyone-else class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>It’s easy to fall into the trap. You read 10 other profiles. You match the tone. You avoid saying anything too specific in case it turns someone off.</p><p>But all that does is make you forgettable.</p><p>I used to hide behind phrases like “collaborative problem-solver” or “user-focused mindset.” Not because they were wrong — but because they were safe.</p><p>Safe doesn’t stand out. And it doesn’t signal confidence.</p><p>You can be professional without being vague. You can be credible without being stiff. And you can be memorable without being loud.</p><hr><h2 id=a-practical-teardown-what-to-kill-and-what-to-keep>A Practical Teardown: What to Kill and What to Keep <a href=#a-practical-teardown-what-to-kill-and-what-to-keep class="hash g">#</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Kill this</strong></th><th><strong>Replace with</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>“I’m passionate about creating user-friendly experiences.”</td><td>“I design products people won’t rage-quit.”</td></tr><tr><td>“Skilled in wireframing, prototyping, design systems…”</td><td>“I sketch fast, ship faster, and love cleaning up messy flows.”</td></tr><tr><td>“I’ve worked across multiple sectors including fintech, healthtech&mldr;”</td><td>“If your product is messy, that’s where I start.”</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Your LinkedIn isn’t a case study. It’s a first impression. Treat it like one.</p><hr><h2 id=voice-isnt-fluff--its-a-filter>Voice Isn’t Fluff — It’s a Filter <a href=#voice-isnt-fluff--its-a-filter class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>The best copy doesn’t just say what you do. It says who you’re for — and who you’re not.</p><p>Voice helps the right people find you. It’s how you attract the clients you actually want, and save yourself the awkward calls with the ones who don’t get it.</p><p>Tone is a design decision. Own it.</p><p><img src=/images/linkedin_p.png alt="Linkedin Profile Crop" loading=lazy decoding=async width=1008 height=600 class=full-width></p><hr><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts <a href=#final-thoughts class="hash g">#</a></h2><p>If your profile reads like it was written by someone trying to please a hiring committee, rewrite it. If it sounds like it could belong to any other designer — rewrite it. If it doesn’t make you smile just a little bit when you read it back — definitely rewrite it.</p><p>Say what you actually do. Be clear. Be a little bold. And if you can, be human.</p><p>Because nobody wants to hire a buzzword. They want to hire you.</p><hr><p><em>This isn’t a case study. It’s just what happened when I finally stopped overthinking it.</em></p><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/donska>View the profile</a></p></div></main></body></html>
